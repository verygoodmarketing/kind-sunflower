Very Good Marketing Co. is a small marketing company based out of Hartselle, AL. The name
actually came from the TV show Parks and Recreation which is a comedy that ran the NBC
network from 2009 to 2015. One of the characters, Ron Swanson, created his own
construction company and named it Very Good Building Co. Everything about the business,
including the name was simple which is where we got our inspiration for our name.

Simple makes sense in a lot of ways. Our goal is to simplify one of the best tools for a
business to get customers; online marketing.

We help small businesses in several different markets get more customers by using Facebook
and Instagram ads. This allows us to target people who are interested in what you have to
offer, track how affect the ads are at producing leads, and test the ads to tweak and make
them better.
