      - question: What is included in the required consultation and setup?
        answer: >-
          There is a lot of work that goes into setting up a Facebook Ads account
          and getting your business ready to run effective ads. The required
          consultation and setup are where we will meet with you for about an hour,
          typically over a Zoom video call while you are at a computer. We will
          discuss the ad or ads you want to run, the offer you want to give in
          your ads, and how much we recommend that you spend running your ads.
          We will also use this time to connect to your Facebook Ads account so
          that we can manage your account on your behalf.
      - question: How long does it take to start seeing my ads on Facebook and Instagram?
        answer: >-
          After our initial meeting, we will set up a date and time to meet again
          for the required consultation and setup. Typically within a week, we
          will be able to have your ads up and running.
      - question: Can I cancel if the results are not what I expect?
        answer: >-
          You can cancel our services for any reason. We just need a 30 day notice
          before the last day that you want service. You can also have us pause the
          ads at anytime to stop Facebook from charging a daily fee. If you decide
          to cancel our services, a new startup fee will be needed to restart ad services.
