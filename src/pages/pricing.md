      - question: What is included in the required consultation and setup?
        answer: >-
          There is a lot of work that goes into setting up a Facebook Ads account
          and getting your business ready to run effective ads. The required
          consultation and setup are where we will meet with you for about an hour,
          typically over a Zoom video call while you are at a computer. We will
          discuss the ad or ads you want to run, the offer you want to give in
          your ads, and how much we recommend that you spend running your ads.
          We will also use this time to connect to your Facebook Ads account so
          that we can manage your account on your behalf.
